# Geospatial Visualization of Accidents in Kiel, Germany

## Project Overview

This Python project utilizes Geopandas to visualize and analyze accident data in the city of Kiel, Germany. The data is sourced from GeoJSON files and processed to create insightful visualizations, providing a comprehensive understanding of accident patterns.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Preparation using Geopandas

- The GeoJSON files containing accident data are read and converted into a Geopandas DataFrame, leveraging the geospatial capabilities of Geopandas for efficient handling of geographic data.

### 2. District-wise Accident Map

- A map of Kiel is created, visualizing the number of accidents per district. This allows for a spatial understanding of accident distribution within the city.

### 3. Time Series Visualization

- Time series visualizations are generated to showcase the number of accidents occurring in different time intervals - hours, weeks, months, and years. This provides insights into temporal trends and patterns.

### 4. Percentage Distribution of Accident Types

- A pie chart is generated to illustrate the percentage distribution of different types of accidents, providing an overview of the most common accident scenarios.

### 5. Relationship Between Different Types of Accidents

- Relationships between different types of accidents are explored through relevant analyses and visualizations, fostering an understanding of correlations or patterns.

## Project Usage

- To replicate the visualizations and analyses, follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter notebook or Python script.
- Ensure the necessary libraries (`geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`) are installed.

## Acknowledgments

- The project relies on the power of Geopandas for geospatial data handling and visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Consider expanding the project with additional analyses, such as hotspot mapping or predictive modeling, to further enhance insights into accident patterns in Kiel.

Feel free to explore and customize the code for more in-depth analysis and visualization based on the specific requirements and objectives of your project.
